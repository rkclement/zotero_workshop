# 2017 Fall Zotero Workshop
  
1. Introduction
    1. Who am I, what are we talking about
    2. Citation and Resource management tools - anyone already using them?
    3. What is Zotero and why would you want to use it
        1. loose translation of the Albanian for “to master”
        2. App, browser connectors
        3. Word/LibreOffice plugins
2. Installing Zotero
    1. Go to [https://www.zotero.org/download/](https://www.zotero.org/download/)
    2. Install the Zotero app (e.g. "Zotero 5.0 for Mac") 
    3. Make sure you have the browser extension(s) that you need
        1. Problems with Safari extension - doesn't work as well as Chrome or Firefox extensions - use those instead, if you can
        2. Currently no extension for IE/Edge or mobile broswers, but there is a [bookmarklet](https://www.zotero.org/downloadbookmarklet) that will work for these, without all the features
    4. Create a free account
        1. Sign in to this account once you open Zotero
        2. We’ll do more with this later
3. Getting stuff into Zotero
    1. Dump some PDFs in - have folder on desktop
        1. Show “retrieve metadata” (works automatically now)
        2. Talk about how this works (file needs to be OCR'd PDF, needs to be something that would be on Google Scholar)
    2. Show “create parent item”
        1. You can now manually enter information
        2. Show different item types - changes the fields available and what they are named
        3. Show that you don't need to fill in **all** fields (i.e. only need ones that are necessary for citation)
        4. Show how to add multiple authors, change between author/editor/translator, and change beteween `last, first` and corporate author
    3. Have open to show browser extension:
        1. Google Scholar
        2. JSTOR (**important** to show that you need to agree to JSTOR TOS **first** before you can download PDFs automatically)
        3. Amazon (good for finding book metadata)
        4. NY Times (or other relevant newspaper site)
        5. YouTube/Vimeo (to show video translator) 
        6. MIDCAT
        7. A relevant library database (something with and something without full-text PDFs can be helpful to point out the difference to students)
    4. Important points to make
        1. Metadata - it is only as good as the database, so check it
        2. Set up an example with something wrong (e.g. author name or title in all caps)
    3. Organizing your stuff in Zotero
        1. Notes - for your annotated bibliography?
            1. You can have as many notes as you want for an item
            2. They are searchable
            3. Can also use the "extras" field in bibliographic metadata for short notes/categorizations
        2. Tags & relations
            1. Can use tags however you want
            2. Some may be automatically downloaded from databases/MIDCAT
        3. Organize it into folders
            1. Folders are not moving items
            2. They can be in multiple folders
            3. Can have subfolders 
    4. Creating from scratch
        1. Use the green plus sign
        2. Can make records for anything you want (e.g. rocks, specimens, whatever)
4. Getting stuff out of zotero
Have open Word -> different icons
Citation styles
Drag & drop
Exporting
Inline citations
Bibliography
Changing styles on the fly
5. Zotero Extras
Syncing your library (300 mb limit)
