Hello [GROUP NAME HERE]!

I will be meeting with you for a workshop on using Zotero to manage your research and create citations [INSERT TIME & DATE HERE]. I look forward to meeting all of you!

Before our meeting, please take the time to download and install Zotero on whichever machine you regularly use and will have in class. Zotero is not installed on all campus computers, but you can access limited functionality for it through any web browser.

Follow the instructions below for installing Zotero and related plug-ins. If you have any questions or run into any problems while installing the software, you can contact me at <EMAIL HERE> or at [LIBGUIDES PROFILE PAGE]. When you contact me, in addition to describing your question/issue, please let me know what operating system you're using (Mac or PC?), which browser you're using (Chrome, Firefox, Safari?), and if you've received any specific error messages. All of these things will help me diagnose your issue.

### Installing Zotero
1. Go to <https://www.zotero.org/download/>
2. Things you should download and install:
  - Zotero 5.0 for Mac/Windows
  - Download browser connector(s) for whichever browser(s) you use
    - Firefox, Safari, or Chrome -> whichever one youâ€™re using will be highlighted, so open download page in different browsers to get other extensions (if you want)
    - Use Firefox or Chrome, if possible, as the Safari extension doesn't offer the full functionality that those browsers do
3. Finally, goto <https://www.zotero.org/user/register> and register for a free user account
  - Allows you to sync across devices, also allows you to create/participate in groups (very useful for group projects)

Thanks for reading, and thanks for getting this set up before class!

Best,
[YOUR NAME HERE]
