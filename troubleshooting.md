# Zotero Troubleshooting

These are some common issues I've run into in teaching faculty and students about Zotero. It's easy to find even more issues and solutions in the Zotero documentation and forums (on the [Zotero website](http://www.zotero.org)), but these are some that I've found to be *very* common. 

1. Zotero Word plugin will not work, even though it says it is installed
    1. If the user is a Mac user, I have noticed that they often have not actually installed the Zotero app properly. They have opened the installer, but they have not copied the Zotero app into their applications. They are just running it from the disk image.
    2. In this case, they need to quit Zotero, and then copy the Zotero app into their applications folder (as instructed by the installer), and then try again.
2. Zotero Word plugin cannot establish a link to the database
    1. This usually happens because the user broke the link between the Word document and the Zotero database by clicking on a citation and editing it within Word, rather than clicking on the citation and then using the "edit citation" function.
    2. In this case, the only solution is to run the "unlink citations" function, and then copy/paste the document into a new Word document. Then the user will need to go through the document and manually re-add every citation (and delete the old record). Then the user can re-add the bibliography.
